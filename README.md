1. Open the Project Folder: Locate and open the folder on your computer where your Flask project files are stored. This folder typically contains your `app.py` file and other related files.

2. Navigate to app.py: Inside the project folder, find the `app.py` file. This file is the main entry point for your Flask application, where the application is defined and routes are set up.

3. Open the Terminal: Launch your terminal or command prompt. This is where you will run commands to start your Flask application.

4. Run Command `python app.py`: In the terminal, type `python app.py` and press Enter. This command starts the Flask server, allowing your application to run and be accessible via a web browser.

5. Open the Link: After running the command, open a web browser and enter the URL `https://127.0.0.1:5000`. This link points to your local server where the Flask application is running. You should see your applicationâ€™s interface if everything is set up correctly.
